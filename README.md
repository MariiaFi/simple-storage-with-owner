# Simple Storage with Owner

## About the Project

This is my practice smart contract written in Solidity.  
I created it to practice saving data on the blockchain and to understand how ownership logic works inside smart contracts.

The contract allows you to store a single number and restricts the ability to update it only to the owner.

## What I Learned During the Process

- How the owner is set during contract deployment through the `constructor`.
- How to use `require` for access control.
- Why it's important to think in advance about who can call which functions.
- That even in very simple contracts, security matters.

---

## What Still Needs Improvement

- So far, I only tested it manually in Remix IDE.
- In the future, I want to learn how to write automated tests.
